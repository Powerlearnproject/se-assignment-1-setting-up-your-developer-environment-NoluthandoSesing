# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

1. I selected Windows as my operating system. I use the older version but I installed the 
Windows 11 by using an installation assistant. This took a very long time but installation 
completed in 3 steps. I did not know I had to ensure my personal data secure but Istill 
have everything. I did not check for the compatibility and therefore I struggled a bit. I 
reverted.
2. I installed visual studio from the link provided during class. I downloaded VS code for 
Windows. After it downloaded I accepted the agreement from the pop up screen. I 
selected the location where it will be saved on the PC. I selected next until I got to the 
screen where I can select additional tasks. I selected the appropriate boxes and 
proceeded to the next screen, which is the “ready to install” and then I clicked on the 
install button. Installation took a while for me, it was not as quick as it was in class. I 
proceed by launching VS code. From class, I understood that files opened in VS code are 
also saved on the PC. It is important to name the file and add “.pyth” or “.readme”
depending on what type of file you want and if you want it to be readable in this 
application. I installed the required extensions as well. 
3. I set up Git and GitHub. I opened my browser and searched install Git on Windows. I 
installed the 64-bit Git for windows .After the download was complete, I opened the 
downloaded file. I selected where Git would be saved on my PC.Next page is the select 
component page, I selected the additional icons and the others had been selected 
already. The following page is the select start folder menu, left the option on the default 
option. Following page is the choosing the default editor used by Git. I selected editor 
recommended by the lecture during the class. Following page is the adjusting the name 
of the initial branch in the new repositories. I chose “Let Git decide” and clicked on next.
The following pages,as requested by lecture,I clicked on next until I can start the 
installation. I checked the Git status. Commited a file in Git. Did Git configuration,
username was my email. I created a Github account and created a new repository. 
4. I installed python from the link provided during class.I selected Python 3.8.6 because of 
the operating system I am using. I clicked on the downloaded file to open it. I selected 
customise installation and proceeded. I clicked on the add path check box it python was 
set up. I was a bit confused due to the lecture notes provided, it recommended python 
3.11.0 but 3.8.6 worked alright too, I might try to get 3.11.0. 
5. Installation of pip command in python. I used a pip command in python. The command 
or pip was not recognized. I searched for cmd and opened the command prompt.I 
applied a command I got during my research which is https://bootstrap.pypa.io/getpip.py . Download began and I executed the file. Used another command to begin 
installation. Then I set an environment variable to enable to use Pip. After these steps,I 
struggled and I am still in the process of getting it set up.
6. MySQL. I followed a link provided in class. I downloaded mysql for Windows. Two 
options were provided bit I chose the latter option and started the download. Right 
clicked and opened the download. Installation started and I chose a setup type. I chose 
custom and clicked next. Selected the products on the following page and clicked 
next.Got to the installation page and clicked on execute,products started to be installed. 
Clicked next until I got to the accounts and roles page. I created a password and clicked 
next. Clicked next until atserver file permissions. I executed in the next page. I set up a 
path in my files by following the steps provided in class.
